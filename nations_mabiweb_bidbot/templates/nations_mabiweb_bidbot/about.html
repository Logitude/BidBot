    <h2>About BidBot for Nations on MaBiWeb</h2>
    <p>
        This site allows players who play the board game, Nations, using
        <a href="http://www.mabiweb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MaBiWeb</a>
        to auction the nations available for a given match. The idea is to
        use bidding to offset the advantages one nation has over another.
        Auctions can already be done using the chat feature of MaBiWeb,
        but since many of the matches played there are played by people living
        in disparate time zones, a style of auction where players take turns
        bidding can take a very long time.
    </p>
    <p>
        To speed things up, players can use a blind auction. With people in the
        same room, a blind auction can be done by having each person write down
        their bid, and then once everyone has bid, revealing the bids simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        That doesn't work for correspondence play. Even if everyone could be
        online at the same time, how could you reveal simultaneously? You would
        need some way to collect the bids without other players seeing what
        bids have already been made and without being able to change theirs in response.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter BidBot! BidBot is a place where players can enter their bids
        without revealing them to other players. Once all players in a match have
        locked in their bid, all of the bids are revealed. BidBot also uses
        the bids to decide who won each nation and for what price.
